The cit190-term-project folder is part of the term project I am creating for my JavaScript class. The task was to create a series of
applications that may be useful in an educational setting, whether in the classroom or as a study aid. This repository contains the scientific calculator application and the periodic table application. The scientific calculator uses ECMAScript 6, particularly the methods available to the Math object, and a liberal use of regular expressions to implement the algebraic order of operations. However, the operations need to be explicitly specified, similar to MATLAB [i.e. the calculator will not recognize (2+3)(4+5)]. The periodic table application displays a tooltip of selected information about an element when its button on the table is clicked. The script will only allow for one tooltip to be open at a time, and clicking on the element's button again will dismiss the tooltip.
