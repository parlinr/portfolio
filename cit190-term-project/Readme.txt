The only things that needs to be pointed out are that all operations with the calculator need to be explicitly
specified (e.g. (2+3)(4+5) needs to be entered as (2+3)*(4+5), a la MATLAB) and all parentheses need to be closed before 
the equals button is pressed. Also, the trigonometric functions on the calculator assume the argument is given in radians.
